University of Washington Computer Science I Assignments
The course Computer Science I  is provided by University of Washington School of Engineering. 

# Course Overview
This course provides an introduction to computer science using the Java programming language. CSE142 is
primarily a programming course, but the focus is on the problem solving techniques common in computer
science. No prior programming experience is assumed, although students should know the basics of using a
computer (e.g., using a web browser and word processing program) and should be competent with math through
Algebra I. Students with significant prior programming experience should consider skipping cse142 and taking
cse143 (we allow students to do so without any special permission).
